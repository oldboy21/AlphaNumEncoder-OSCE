# AlphaNumeric Encoder - OSCE 

## Disclaimer 
Small disclaimer before proceeding with the read: Yes, I know, It's written in python2. It's just an old tool i wrote while working on the OSCE exam preparation which i find nice
to publish only today.

## Ok cool, but what does this old tool do? 

Given a shellcode, it should be able to give you as output another encoded shellcode which bypass alphanumeric restrictions.
